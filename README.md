# Html-CSS-JS
Html, CSS, and JavaScript Eagle Award notes.

Hi, this is my folder which I have taken all the notes/examples from the coding tutorials which I have learnt from. 
Here is the link to the first tutorial that I am learning: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU6anWqZJcc&t=13189s
I might complete my 10 hours without being able to acheive my goal since only the Html and CSS tutorial is 11 hours long. But, if I still have time left, I will move onto this JavaScript tutorial which uses Html and CSS in it also. https://youtu.be/jS4aFq5-91M

To access my code, please click on the "htmlandcsstutorial" folder. All the files and folders in there contain all of the notes and code examples that I have written down and you can see them just by clicking on any individual file and it will open. Also, keep in mind that the images folder are images for examples in the code of how I can display images in it.
