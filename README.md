# Html-CSS-JS
Html, CSS, and JavaScript Eagle Award notes/examples.

Hi, this is my folder which I have taken all the notes/examples from the coding tutorials which I have learnt from. 
Here is the link to the first tutorial that I am learning: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU6anWqZJcc&t=13189s
I might complete my 10 hours without being able to acheive my goal since only the Html and CSS tutorial is 11 hours long. But, if I still have time left, I will move onto this JavaScript tutorial which uses Html and CSS in it also. https://youtu.be/jS4aFq5-91M

Notice: The code has comments and code examples so they will be my evidence and notes. Github is not able to run this code but if you happen to have an IDE on your computer and it is able to run this code, feel free to download it and see what the website looks like.

Weekly Update 1: Sep 21
I have gotten through about 4 out of the 11 hours on the Html and CSS tutorial. I have also made this Github Repository so that mentors would be able to track my progress all the time and see what I've been working on. As I make changes to the code in the code editor(Microsoft Visual Studio Code 2019), it will update the repository so that people can track my progress better.
