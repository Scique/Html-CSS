# Html-CSS-JS
A repository for storing my Html, CSS and JavaScript notes/examples that I have learned from the Tutorial.

Hi, this is my folder which I have taken all the notes/examples from the coding tutorials which I have learnt from. 
Here is the link to the first tutorial that I am learning: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU6anWqZJcc&t=13189s
I might complete my 10 hours without being able to acheive my goal since only the Html and CSS tutorial is 11 hours long. But, if I don't reach the deadline to complete my project before I finish this tutorial, I will move onto this JavaScript tutorial(it also has some Html and CSS in it) https://youtu.be/jS4aFq5-91M

Update 1: Sep 21
I have gotten through about 4 out of the 11 hours on the Html and CSS tutorial. I have also made this Github Repository so that mentors would be able to track my progress all the time and see what I've been working on.
